### Background 

I'm a physicist, a programmer and a self-confessed computer nerd.

Ever since my Dad introduced me to a soldering iron and a pcb schematic I've been obsessed with computers and discovering how they work.

I started my programming career at a young age when I wrote my first game in basic on a Commodore 64. Since then my career has evolved to projects ranging from computational physics through to web and application development.

I believe in standards, code reusability and open source and I take pride in producing simple and elegant solutions to coding problems.


### Work 

I am a founder of [@distriqt](https://github.com/distriqt).

Currently I develop mobile applications and games and specialise in cross-platform extensions/plugins for multiple frameworks including Unity, AIR, Haxe and Flutter.

- [Unity](https://assetstore.unity.com/publishers/46451)

> I am also looking for sponsorship or collaboration on the [AIR package manager](https://github.com/airnativeextensions/apm). Appreciate any help to get this tool into development:
