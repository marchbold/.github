### Background 

I'm a physicist, a programmer and a self-confessed computer nerd.

Ever since my Dad introduced me to a soldering iron and a pcb schematic I've been obsessed with computers and discovering how they work.

I started my programming career at a young age when I wrote my first game in basic on a Commodore 64. Since then my career has evolved to projects ranging from computational physics through to web and application development.

I believe in standards, code reusability and open source and I take pride in producing simple and elegant solutions to coding problems.
